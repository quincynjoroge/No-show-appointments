# No-show-appointments
This is an analysis exploring the potential reasons as to why a person would make a doctor's appointment and not show up.
The data was sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/omarashraffathy/no-show-appointments-dataset-analysis/data)

# EDA
We cleaned the data and explored these five questions:

1. What is the gender ratio of individuals who showed up for their appointment vs those who did not?
2. What is the proportion of people that showed up for their appointment and received an SMS?
3. Which hospital location had majority show-up appointments and which one had the least show-up?
4. Does having a scholarship affect whether or not someone shows up for their appointment?
5. Is there a relationship of show up rate and different disease factors?
